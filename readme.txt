NOTE :- When I was bluiding this project I doesn't have proper name for it, so I named it as '21Hexagons' since it consists of 21 hexagons. Later I deciced to change name to 'Fill The Hexagon'. So, when you see '21Hexagons' or 'Fill The Hexagons', they represent same thing or project.

About The Project :- 
* This project is made in Godot Game Engine using C# progaming language. The executable and activity diagram are in 'Fill-The-Hexagons.zip' file.
